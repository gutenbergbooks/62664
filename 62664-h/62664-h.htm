<p>The Southwest has had a most romantic history. It is the oldest portion,
both in the way of interior exploration and in the way of settlement, in the
United States.</p>
<p>The Coronado Expedition of several hundred Spaniards left Mexico in
1540 and journeyed up into what is now central New Mexico. The convoy
consisted of soldier aristocrats on their caparisoned horses and in their picturesque
regalia, and of common soldiers, fortune seekers and servants. Accompanying
the train were hundreds of horses packed with supplies and hundreds of
cattle, sheep and hogs for food purposes.</p>
<p>They established themselves at Tiguex, New Mexico and spent two years,
1540-42, conquering the Indians and searching for treasure. One party went
west and discovered the Grand Canon and another went east as far as
Kansas. They found no riches but explored, mapped and named the country
and took possession of it for Spain.</p>
<p>New Mexico was settled in 1595, permanently, except for a short period
when the populace fled because of an Indian uprising. The first capital was
San Juan though it was soon moved to nearby Santa Fe. It should be noticed
that this settlement preceded colonization on our eastern coast.</p>
<p>No one knows when the Spanish first entered Colorado but the country
seemed well-known and named when Juan Rivera made his first trip into it in
1765. He led a party across the southwestern part of the state to the Utah
border and back to the Gunnison River near Hotchkiss. Within the next ten
years he made three more trips of the same kind.</p>
<p>The Escalante expedition of 1776 wanted to find a northern route from
Santa Fe to Los Angeles. They followed the same trail as had Rivera to Hotchkiss
but from there went north and then west to Utah Lake. Because of a
shortage of food they started home, crossing Utah, the Colorado River and
Arizona and arriving at Zuni, New Mexico. This party very thoroughly
mapped and named everything in the course of the journey.</p>
<p>The most commonly traveled route across Colorado was the &ldquo;Old Spanish
<span class="pb" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
Trail&rdquo;, used in the 1830&rsquo;s and 40&rsquo;s by trade caravans operating between Santa
Fe and Los Angeles, woolen goods going to the west and horses and mules
to the east. It traversed Colorado, Utah and southern Nevada. All of these
caravans, incidentally, crossed the Animas River and Ridges Basin Pass just at
the south edge of Durango. This last part was later used by the American
pioneers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, trappers were thoroughly working every stream in southwestern
Colorado and selling their furs at Taos or Santa Fe.</p>
<p>After the war with Mexico and due to the treaty of 1848 the United States
acquired all of the southwestern part of the country.</p>
<p>Gold was discovered on Cherry Creek, the Denver area, in 1859 and a
rush to that place began. The same year Captain Baker led a prospecting
group into what was later Silverton and named the spot &ldquo;Baker&rsquo;s Park&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Two years later he, with another party, made his way up the Animas River
and established the little town of Animas City, fifteen miles north of present
Durango. There the settlers panned the river for gold and built the first bridge
in all of southwestern Colorado, &ldquo;Baker&rsquo;s Bridge&rdquo;. The panning Operation was
not successful and, on news of the outbreak of the Civil War, the whole
citizenry precipitately departed.</p>
<p>After the Civil War a young man by the name of Otto Mears moved into
the Saguache country and went into the wheat raising and merchandising
businesses. To get his wheat to market he had to start building roads. He ended
up with about 450 miles of roads which laced together all of the mountain
towns in the extremely rugged San Juan Mountains.</p>
<p>Mears served as Indian Commissioner for a number of years and, as such,
negotiated several treaties with the Utes. The first one in 1868 forced them
out of central Colorado, the second one in 1873 forced them out of the San
Juan Mountains and the third one in 1881 forced them out of Colorado entirely.</p>
<p>The Denver and Rio Grande Railroad arrived in Durango in 1881 and
in Silverton the next year. Meanwhile it was building another line from
Salida to Grand Junction and arrived there in 1883. Four years later a branch
<span class="pb" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
was run from Montrose to Ouray.</p>
<p>The same year, 1887, the Silverton Railroad, one of the subjects of this
booklet, started out of Silverton and was completed in 1889. The next one,
also a Mears creation, was the Rio Grande Southern, built in &rsquo;90 and &rsquo;91, which
ran from Ridgway via Telluride and Rico to Durango.</p>

<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">THE SILVERTON RAILROAD</span></h2>
<p>The Silverton Railroad! The most intriguing piece of narrow gauge in the
world! The railroad of the steepest grades, the sharpest curves, the crookedest
loops, the highest altitude and the oddest switchbacks, on one of which sat
a wye with a depot inside and on the other a housed-over turntable! And the
railroad of the famous Otto Mears passes!</p>
<p>Otto Mears and Fred Walsen, after the Opening up of the rich Yankee
Girl mine made it feasible, in 1882 and &rsquo;83 built a toll road they called the
&ldquo;Rainbow Route&rdquo; from Ouray to Silverton. This was the most famous and the
most difficult piece of road engineering of the day. The line crept along the
precipitous mountains of the Uncompahgre River and Red Mountain Creek
canons and in places was cut out of sheer granite walls. It was so narrow and
crooked in places that only by the expedient of backing up or unhitching a
buggy and setting it on a sidehill could another conveyance get by. The grades
were so steep, often 19%, that most of the early cars could not climb them.
It was the road of the famous Bear Creek toll bridge where a driver stopped
and parted with his cash, $2 for a saddle horse or $5 for a buggy and team.</p>
<p>While Mears and Walsen were constructing their road from Ouray to Red
Mountain in the summer of 1882, the Denver and Rio Grande was completing
its railroad from Durango to Silverton. The next year while Mears and
Walsen were extending their road from Red Mountain to Silverton, the
D. &amp; R. G., through its construction engineer, Thomas Wigglesworth, was making
a survey from Silverton to Red Mountain and Ironton Park. Nothing came
of it but one wonders if it did not give Mears the idea of building a railroad
himself.</p>
<p>The Silverton Railroad was incorporated on July 5, 1887 and chartered
on July 8. Mears was the president of the company and John L. McNeil was
the treasurer. Though we have no evidence to the effect, Walsen was, without
doubt, an incorporator and official. Since much of the Rainbow Route toll
road grade was to be used the railroad adopted the name. Incidentally
a new wagon road had to be built.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>The first part from Silverton to Chattanooga would not be too difficult
but Red Mountain would have to be ascended on a steep grade and by many
curves to the summit, Sheridan Pass. Then the line would have to go around a
succession of curves to Red Mountain town and over more curves, grades and
switchbacks from there down to Ironton. The greatest of engineering skill was
necessary to accomplish such an undertaking.</p>
<p>The first necessity, of course, was a locomotive. So the company purchased
the D. &amp; R. G.&rsquo;s No. 42, a Baldwin of 30 tons, called 60 class. It was overhauled
and given the number &ldquo;100&rdquo; and the name &ldquo;Ouray&rdquo;. The number may be seen
on the old-fashioned kerosene headlight in a picture herein.</p>
<p>The 5.3 miles of railroad from Silverton to Burro Bridge must have been
constructed in the summer of 1887 for it is known to have been in operation
by the first of June of the next year. In 1888 Charles W. Gibbs, who had
served under Mr. Wigglesworth on a number of projects, became the locating
and construction engineer. He started late in May at Burro Bridge and in early
November had completed 11.2 miles through Red Mountain and to Ironton.
Only 11.2 miles in over five months! But anyone acquainted with the country is
not surprised.</p>
<p>Spurs then or later were laid to the Yankee Girl, Vanderbilt, North
Star, Silver Bell, Guston and Treasury Tunnel. The map here included
was made by Mr. Gibbs and appeared in a September 1890 Bulletin of the
American Society of Civil Engineers. Mr. Gibbs built the 1.5 miles from Ironton
to Albany in 1889.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> Albany was the Saratoga mill which stood against
the east hill of Ironton Park. His report notes 5% grades, 30&deg; curves, 3-foot
gauge and 30-lb. rail. No reliable figures for the cost of construction are available
but ordinarily a railroad of that kind at that time ate up about $25,000
to the mile.</p>
<p>In 1888 Mr. Gibbs was writing love letters to Miss Adeline Hammon of
Colorado Springs and the next year they were married. She has kept his letters
all these years from which these excerpts, dealing with the construction of the
railroad from Burro Bridge to Ironton, are taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chattanooga, June 10, 1888. Arrived here bag and baggage about three
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
weeks ago and have my headquarters 10,200 feet above sea level and my next
camp will be still higher, about 11,000 feet. More than 100 Mexican workers
camped nearby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gustine Mine, July 22, 1888. I am occupying the house of a former mine
superintendent and have many conveniences not found in a railroad camp.
Went to Silverton on the passenger train last night and returned this morning.
Regular trains are running to where my first camp was (Chattanooga) and in
a month&rsquo;s time will be here and maybe they will get track laid before that as
the grading will be done in two weeks time. About 400 Mexicans working.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gustine Mine, August 11, 1888. Work is getting along splendidly and
during this week I will get surveys made to Ironton which is as far as the line
will be built this year. By the middle of next week the work will be only two
miles from here and in a very short time at my door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gustine Mine, September 16, 1888. Construction work will be done in
about five weeks; then I shall go to Telluride to make a short survey for a three
foot gauge road.&rdquo; (This became the Rio Grande Southern.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ironton, October 3, 1888. Since writing you I have moved from the
Gustine Mine to Ironton and we are living in a large vacant hotel, lots of
room but not the conveniences we had at the mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ironton, October 29, 1888. Since my last letter to you I discharged all
my men but one and moved to Silverton but was put in charge of the
work train and the track laying outfit so am back in the grader&rsquo;s camp but
will be done here in about a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wyes were placed at Sheridan Junction, Red Mountain and Ironton in
1888 and at Albany the next year. That of the D. &amp; R. G. was used at Silverton.
Very little room was available at Red Mountain and so only the smallest kind of
wye could be made&mdash;one just big enough to accommodate an engine and a car
and the depot had to be set inside of it.</p>
<p>Not counting the wyes there was only one switchback, that at Corkscrew
Gulch, the most famous in the world as it contained a housed-over turntable.</p>
<p>Curvature was almost continuous. Four curves were particularly sharp&mdash;those
at Chattanooga, Red Mountain, Joker Tunnel and Ironton. Steep grades
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
were also almost continuous, some as much as 5%. Some maps have shown
the grade at Chattanooga as 7%. This is an error. Mr. Gibbs, the builder, stated
it was 5% and a recent survey has substantiated his figure.</p>
<p>Bridges, as compared to those on the Rio Grande Southern Railroad,
were very small, there being, outside of water boxes and culverts, only three.
Two were on the main line, one where the railroad crossed Mineral Creek at
Chattanooga and the other where the railroad crossed Red Mountain Creek at
Joker Tunnel. The other one was on the Treasury Tunnel Branch.</p>
<p>The name of Burro Bridge for the station at milepost 5.3 is very misleading
since the railroad sported no span at all at that point. The supposition is
that the word applied to the wagon-road bridge across Mineral Creek somewhat
below and away from the railroad. This road branched off from the main
Silverton-Red Mountain highway about five and one-half miles north of
Silverton, crossed Mineral Creek and made its way up Middle Fork Gulch and
across Ophir Pass to Ophir. This, first a burro trail and later a very rugged
wagon road, was in use for perhaps fifteen years before the advent of the rail
line. Since the Silverton Railroad unloaded freight for Ophir in the neighborhood
of Burro Bridge it is assumed that this was the reason for the adoption
of the name for the station.</p>
<p>The town of Chattanooga eventually grew up to the left of the location
shown on the map in order to avoid Mineral Creek floods.</p>
<p>No account of the arrival of the first train in Red Mountain has been
found but it is known to have occurred on September 17, 1888. A picture herein
shows the train with Engine 100 and Mears standing beside the pilot. It can be
assumed that it was a gala occasion, especially for the mines, for here was an
efficacious way of getting supplies and of shipping ore.</p>
<p>The unloading of freight on the Silverton Railroad was quite informal.
Outside of Red Mountain the line maintained no bona fide stations or agents.
Therefore, materials were dropped off, especially for the mines, at the most
convenient points.</p>
<p>So far the railroad owned only one locomotive, Number 100, and so had
to rent from the D. &amp; R. G. The same was true of cars and coaches.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>The railroad had been projected to Ouray, 26.6 miles in all. Mears
might have used his toll road but that was, in some places, 19 per cent grade,
out of the question for a railroad. The steepest ever attempted in Colorado was
7.6%. Construction from Ironton to the foot of Ironton Park would have
been easy but there the canon began where the greater part of six miles
would have had to be blasted out of solid rock, where slide rock could
have been quite bothersome, where snow blockades would have been continuous
for a long winter and where snowslides, two in particular, the
Riverside and the Mother Cline, that ran every year, would have been almost
impossible to conquer. The Riverside slide that came from two sides, filling
the canon and burying the wagon road, often had to be tunnelled to accommodate
the summer traffic. The writer, with her parents, was through one in
the summer of 1903 or &rsquo;04.</p>
<p>At the same time surveys were made for another branch of the system,
one that was to go up the Animas River from Silverton to Mineral Point,
19 miles, and possibly across the divide to Lake City.</p>
<p>Through operation to Ironton began in June 1889. The claim that two
daily passenger trains ran there has generally been disbelieved but the following
table for 1889, copied from the Official Railway Guide of May 1891,
proves the point.</p>

<p>Everything was finished and working properly. Mr. Gibbs must have
had the feeling of &ldquo;well done&rdquo; and that he deserved a reward. Mrs. Gibbs
tells the following story:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Late in September of 1889, Mr. Gibbs and I were married at Colorado
Springs and started for Silverton, going by the way of Montrose and through
Ouray where we stayed overnight at the beautiful Beaumont Hotel. The next
morning we rode the stage to Ironton and there transferred to the little
Silverton Railroad train. As we climbed the grade toward the summit the
conductor came through the coach where I was the only passenger and asked me
if I were cold. I couldn&rsquo;t deny it so he stopped the train, picked up some wood
along the track and built a fire in the little pot-bellied stove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In November and December Mr. Gibbs made a preliminary survey from
the town of Dallas to Telluride, which was to be the route for the Rio Grande
Southern Railroad, and finished the day before Christmas. We stayed overnight
in Ouray and left the next morning in a snow-storm. When we reached
Ironton my husband heard the line was blocked by snow so he left me with
the Strayers while he went on to Silverton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He made arrangements for me to meet him in Red Mountain on New
Year&rsquo;s day, which I did. Two men besides us were going to Silverton. A shallow
trail had been beaten in the deep snow between the rails. The two men
held the ends of a ski pole while I hung to the middle of it and we plodded
down the track. We came to a sharp hairpin curve and cut it out by sliding
downhill from the track above to the one below. A few miles farther on we
reached an engine with a snowplow, which was a great relief. When we
reached Silverton and got to our room a nice warm dinner was sent up to us
by Moses Liverman, superintendent of the S. R.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few days latter we left for my husband&rsquo;s old home in Maine. This
is what we had planned for our wedding trip but my daughters have always
maintained that the others to Silverton by stage and train with all their difficulties
were really the wedding journey.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>

drainage) did not exist at the time the map was made but was projected

<p>The exaggerated mileages of the 1889 timetable would have added considerably
to the freight charges, in the case of Ironton over 21%. It will
be noticed beginning with Red Mountain that each Mears figure is 3 to 3&frac12;
miles more than the Kelly figure. Mr. Kelly was one of the ablest engineers
of his day and his mileages cannot be questioned.</p>
<p>The table below was copied from an Official Railway Guide of October
1893 but no date is given for the time it was in effect. It is interesting because
the mileages are different and because, at the time, only one passenger train
was running.</p>

<p>All carrier lines issued paper passes but Mears wanted to do something
special for <i>his</i> railroad. Outside of the paper ones his passes fell into four
categories&mdash;buckskin, plate, medallion and filigree. The first three were for the
Silverton Railroad alone while the fourth, though made especially for the
Rio Grande Southern Railroad, was usable on the S. R.</p>
<p>There were two designs of the silver plate pass. It is supposed that the
first die broke and a substitute had to be made. The medallion passes, ordinarily
silver, have the date 1890, the number and the name of the recipient
on the back. Two extra-special ones have come to light. Each is made of
two <i>gold</i> medallions set back to back and hinged to form a locket and each
has a little diamond in the face. An odd silver pass, a spoon with a plate pass
hanging from underneath, has been discovered. The filigrees, silver and gold,
have been extensively treated in the book, <i>Rio Grande Southern Story</i>.</p>
<p>According to an item in a Rico <i>Sun</i> of November 28, 1891, copied from
a Denver <i>Sun</i>, a company called &ldquo;Ouray and Ironton Electric Railway, Light
and Power,&rdquo; consisting of Mears, Walsen, Charles Munn, James H. Cassanova
and William H. Wallace, with capital of $800,000, filed articles of
incorporation with the Secretary of State on November 20. Its purpose was
to build a cog road from Ouray to Ironton, with a branch up Poughkeepsie
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
Gulch (Uncompahgre River) to the head of Cement Creek.</p>
<p>The following quotation is from Mr. Arthur Ridgway:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The assumption that Mr. Mears contemplated extending the S. R. from
Ironton to Ouray is correct but he was deterred because of its being so formidable
an undertaking. He may have considered Albany as the possible point
for the origin of the extension at first but later Ironton proved the more
feasible. Anyway, he had a preliminary location for an <i>electric</i> railway, Ouray
to Ironton, made in 1892 by the then noted locating engineer, R. L. Kelly.
No doubt the impracticability if not the utter impossibility, of operating
steam locomotives over the heavy grades and severe curvature known to be
necessary dissuaded him from the purpose until the recognized practicability
of electric railway operation became apparent in 1892. Whatever the delay
(a long one for Mr. Mears) it was not until 1892 that a survey was made
and even then, as stated before, for electric operation. The map I
have of the completed location shows a line starting from a connection with the
Denver &amp; Rio Grande at the Ouray depot, eight miles in length, to a connection
near the Ironton depot, incorporating 7% maximum gradients and 35&deg; maximum
rate of curvature. With even these severe physical characteristics considerable
tunnelling was necessary. I do not have the estimated cost of the
project but it must have been staggering. It is small wonder that with the
difficulty of financing so costly a scheme and the great financial panic a year
later in 1893, together with the contemporary decadence of silver mining,
the project was permanently shelved by even the visionary Mr. Mears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>D. &amp; R. G. track already lay between Ouray and Ridgway and between
Silverton and Durango. Mr. Mears, by the end of 1891, had completed the
Rio Grande Southern from Ridgway to Durango. Only eight miles from
Ironton to Ouray were needed to make a complete 243 mile circle. If only
that eight miles could have been constructed! Then a sightseer could have
started at Ridgway, taken a side trip to Telluride (14.6 miles), proceeded to Durango,
to Silverton and back to starting point. He should not have attempted
it in the winter or spring because of snow blockades or snowslides but in
the summer or fall he could have had the thrill of a lifetime.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>He would have looked upon or wended his way among snowcapped
peaks, hundreds over 12,000 or 13,000 feet high and some over 14,000 feet,
many so sharp as to be termed &ldquo;needles&rdquo;; would have crossed several passes,
one over 10,000 feet and another over 11,000 feet in altitude; would have
gone up one canyon and down another, often beside rushing, tumbling rivers.
He would have passed over breathtakingly high bridges, over trestles set against
bare cliffs, around U-curves innumerable, over switchbacks, over a turntable,
through rock tunnels and even through snow tunnels.</p>
<p>But the thrills and scenery would have been tempered with trouble, that
trouble-trouble-boil-and-bubble kind, such as delays because of engines having
to blow up, hot boxes, trees across the track, boulders and lots of them on the
track, mudslides, washouts, a derailed engine or car or a couple of each and
a missing bridge or two.</p>
<p>If his luck were still holding he would have ridden the last lap on the
electric railway, down the awesome Red Mountain Creek and Uncompahgre
River canyons where sheer rock walls would have risen hundreds of feet above
him and dropped hundreds of feet below him and, as he turned a last curve, he
would have beheld the never-to-be-forgotten sight of the little town of Ouray,
the gem of all mountain towns, nestled in a deep pocket surrounded by towering
peaks.</p>
<h3 id="c4">THE SILVERTON RAILROAD COMPANY</h3>
<p><span class="lr">Denver, Colorado</span>
<span class="lr">March 28th, 1892.</span></p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>I beg to hand you herewith a report from the auditor of the earnings
of the Silverton Railroad for the years 1889, 1890 and 1891, showing also
the mileage and bonded debt.</p>
<p>I may add for your information that this road is built through the famous
Red Mountain district of the San Juan Country, in which are located the
well-known Yankee Girl and Guston mines, besides many other producing
properties.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>This is the only road that can be built through this district because of
lack of room. The mines mentioned are large producers, and there are many
more which are being developed rapidly. This is one of the best known mining
districts in Colorado. From Ironton to the town of Ouray, which is reached
by another branch of the Denver &amp; Rio Grande, the distance is seven miles
over very precipitous country.</p>
<p>The reason the road has not been extended to Ouray is because of the
excessive cost, but capitalists are now engaged in making estimates and plans
for an electric road to cover this distance to follow the line of the Mears toll
road as indicated on the map. (No map accompanies this material.) A line
of this kind can be built to operate much more cheaply than a railway line,
and we have good reason to expect that this gap may be so filled during this
year. At the present time stages make daily trips each way over the toll road,
and the trip from Silverton to Ouray is a favorite one with the tourists on
account of the beauty and grandeur of the scenery on the toll road.</p>
<p>There is every reason to expect that the earnings for the year 1892 will
increase in the same proportion as in the past, and will continue for a great
many years. The Silverton Railroad is also authorized to build up the Animas
River. We would like very much this year to extend the road in that direction
some 12 or 15 miles in order to reach a very rich and valuable mining district.
There are a great many very extensive mines of low grade material lying
between Silverton and the summit of the range towards the northeast, and
our object in offering to you the bonds of the present line of the railroad is to
obtain funds to extend the line up the Animas River.</p>
<p>We can offer you at the present time $400,000 out of a total of $425,000.
These bonds are issued in denominations of $1,000 each. The interest is payable
semi-annually on the first of April and the first of October at the rate
of six per cent per annum in U. S. gold coin.</p>

<hr />
<p class="center">By <span class="sc">C. W. Gibbs</span>, M. Am. Soc. C. E.</p>
<hr />
<p class="center smaller">WITH DISCUSSION.</p>
<p>The Silverton Railroad is a short line but 17.5 miles long, and has the reputation
of being the steepest (5 per cent. grade), the crookedest (30 degree curves) and the
best paying road in Colorado; and is owned by one man, Otto Mears. It also has a
turn-table on its main track, and it is the purpose of this paper to describe it and
explain why it was so placed.</p>
<p>This road leaves the Denver and Rio Grande at Silverton, and runs over a
divide 11&nbsp;113 feet above sea level, then down into the rich mining country beyond.
The country is very rough and rugged, and in order to reach the town of Red
Mountain it was necessary to run up on a switchback, as no room for a loop could
be found. A wye was, therefore, built, and the engine could be turned while the train
stood on the main track. The engine was thus placed ahead of the train, only the
train is pulled out of the station rear end ahead. It runs thus till the turn-table is
reached. The train is stopped at a point marked A, <a href="#fig1">Plate XXII</a>; the engine uncoupled,
run on to the table, is turned and pulled up to a point near B, where it is stopped.
The train is then allowed to drop down to the turn-table and the engine backed on
to it. In coming up from Albany the train is stopped on the down grade between
the summit at B and the table; the engine is taken off, turned on the table and
run up to about A; the train is then allowed to drop to the table as before
and the engine backed up and coupled on, taking not over five minutes in going
either way.</p>
<p>The reason of putting the table in was that there were no mines to the east of
Ironton as shown on <a href="#fig2">Plate XXI</a>, but between the turn-table and the loop there were
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
several that it was very desireable to reach, and the side hill is so steep that it
is impossible to make a loop on it.</p>
<p>This table is the source of a great deal of comment from tourists, of whom
there are many during the summer months, as it is on the line known as the
&ldquo;circle,&rdquo; so extensively advertised by the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad.</p>
<p>The road is used both for a freight and passenger road, and as before mentioned,
is the best paying road in Colorado, two engines being kept busy hauling ore to
Silverton from the Red Mountain district.</p>
<p>The object of writing this paper was to describe what the author thinks is quite
a novelty, being the only turn-table that he has ever heard of which is used upon a
switchback in this manner, and where the grades are adjusted as they are to let the
train run by gravity on the table from both ways.</p>
<p><a href="#fig2">Plate XXI</a> is a print from a photograph of the map filed in Washington, and is
about 9&nbsp;000 feet to the inch.</p>
<p><a href="#fig1">Plate XXII</a> is an enlarged sketch of the line near the turn-table.</p>
<p class="tbcenter"><b><span class="large">DISCUSSION.</span></b></p>
<p>J. Foster Cromwell, M. Am. Soc. C. E.&mdash;It occurs to me that the use of this
turn-table being simply to turn the engine during transit, while the train waits, and,
moreover, as the service is a special one on a spur line, it would have been better
to obtain an engine capable of running in either direction and not requiring to be
turned, rather than resort to a turn-table in the main track which contains an element
of danger as well as of delay to the traffic. The device, however, is an ingenious one to
meet the peculiar conditions of line; and if experience with it proves satisfactory, there
are other problems on a larger scale relating to change of direction in mountain
location that it may help to solve.</p>
<p>C. W. Gibbs, M. Am. Soc. C. E.&mdash;If a special engine had been procured, as
Mr. Crowell suggests, it would have been at an extra expense, owing to the limited
number wanted; and even with a special design, it might have been difficult for any
engine to have backed its load over so steep a grade and such sharp curves without
more danger than was suggested there might be at the turn-table. The delay to traffic
amounts to nothing, for there are no competing lines, nor do I expect there ever
will be. The turn-table has now been in actual operation every day since June, 1889,
and no accident has ever occurred.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>As has already been noted Engine 100 was purchased and put into service
as soon as the railroad started operating.</p>
<p>The Rio Grande Southern Railroad bought a number of engines in both
1890 and &rsquo;91 and, as it was not yet in operation and did not need so many, it
kept its sister railroad in supply. A record of those it loaned to the S. R. in
1892 is as follows:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">No. 8&mdash;January 1 to April 12</p>
<p class="t0">No. 5&mdash;July 7 to November 19</p>
<p class="t0">No. 7&mdash;August 14 to September 2</p>
<p class="t0">No. 6&mdash;September 2 to October 10</p>
<p class="t0">No. 34&mdash;November 27 to December 31</p>
</div>
<p>A picture of No. 5 with a train at Summit may be found herein.</p>
<p>It has always been supposed that the Shay engine belonged originally to
the Silverton Railroad but the Lima Locomotive Works&rsquo; records reveal that
Mears bought it under his own name in the spring of 1890. It, as No. 269,
was used on construction of the Rio Grande Southern throughout that year
and the next.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t known how or when it got into the possession of the S. R. but
it was with that company in the summer of 1892 and a picture of it on the
lower leg of the turntable track exists. It seems to have been called both
&ldquo;Ironton&rdquo; and &ldquo;Guston&rdquo; during this period. It was traded to the R. G. S. for
the latter&rsquo;s Engine 34 on November 27, 1892. (Note that the table above shows
the 34 merely on loan. The trade date, however, is correct.)</p>
<p>Locomotive 34 was a Baldwin of the 56 class which had, before going
to the R. G. S., belonged to both the D. &amp; R. G. and the R. G. W. The S. R.
numbered it &ldquo;101&rdquo; but several years later changed it to a mere &ldquo;1&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Red Mountain and Ironton became two flourishing towns with plenty of
stores and all the appurtenances of civilization. In the eighties and early
nineties Red Mountain had three newspapers. In 1890 it had a population
of 598 while Ironton had 322. Even Chattanooga had a mill, some stores and
51 people. The locality was a beehive of activity as mines and mills were working
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
every place. The hills were liberally sprinkled with houses, stores, mills,
boarding houses, barns and mine buildings. An incendiary fire at Red Mountain
on August 20, 1892 destroyed practically the whole town causing property
damage estimated at $259,000. But nothing daunted these optimists. They
immediately went about rebuilding it.</p>
<p>The transportation of supplies to the district&mdash;machinery, timbers for
mines, lumber, living necessities, coal and feed for animals&mdash;must have been
terrific for such little trains to handle. Return trains carried ore bound for
the smelters at Silverton and Durango. A company in which Mears was interested
built a smelter, the Standard, at Durango in 1889, to handle copper
ore from the Red Mountain area but it did not prove a success. Eventually, in
1897, the property was sold and rased. The slag pile may still be seen just
south of town.</p>
<p>Operation, not counting sharp curves and steep grades, was complicated.
Turning facilities were numerous for such a short piece of railroad&mdash;Silverton,
Sheridan Junction, Red Mountain, Corkscrew Gulch, Ironton and Albany.
The Operation of the turntable has already been exhibited. It, very soon
after completion, began having trouble with snow, and a long entrance shed
was built to alleviate the condition. Each leg of the wye at Red Mountain
would accommodate only two cars, and so the engine and baggage car went
around it and hooked onto the other end of the coaches.</p>
<p>Four regular freights and probably an extra one or two operated. The
company did not have enough engines or anything else for such traffic and so
must have borrowed from the R. G. S. and the D. &amp; R. G. Passenger business
was only a sideline but Mears maintained the dignity of his little railroad
by running daily, each way, two passenger trains, each with two or three
coaches and baggage car. He charged 20c per mile straight and had all the
riders he could handle.</p>
<p>Business had been very good, so good, in fact, that the Silverton Railroad
had the reputation of being the best-paying for its size in the state. Mears even
used profit from it to assist the R. G. S. which was not doing as well as had
been expected.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>An extension of the Silverton Railroad up the Animas River Valley had
been considered for several years. It became a reality in 1893 when the two
miles from Silverton to the Silver Lake mill at Waldheim were built. It was
considered a part of the S. R. system, not a separate line.</p>
<p>The San Juan&rsquo;s most common precious metal was silver. Others were gold,
lead, zinc and copper. Trouble had been brewing for some time but when
the government repealed the Sherman Silver Purchasing Act in 1893 a panic
descended not only on the San Juan but on all of the United States.</p>
<p>All mining towns had, of course, boomed and were replete with hordes
of promoters, prospectors, miners and hangers-on. Saloons, gambling joints and
brothels flourished. Now, mines closed by the dozens and the populace departed.
Many towns, especially the small ones, were practically deserted. Train
operation came down to a mixed freight and passenger.</p>
<p>As some of Mears&rsquo; letters indicate, he was, after the panic, having
a most difficult time in making ends meet. He gave up the Rio Grande Southern
almost immediately and allowed it to go into receivership on the 2nd of
August, 1893. He tried, however, to hang on to the Silverton Railroad but,
as some of the letters reveal, he had to do a good deal of juggling with bonds,
stocks and notes to stave off creditors.</p>
<p>In 1896 the company claimed 18.25 miles of track from Silverton to
Albany, 3.75 miles of branches and .48 miles of spurs. In the same year it
listed two locomotives, three combination cars, 36 box cars, one caboose and
one &ldquo;other&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Even with the hard times Mears managed by borrowing to extend the
railroad in 1896 from Waldheim to the Sunnyside mine at Eureka, another
6&frac12; miles. This entire piece, Silverton to Eureka, he incorporated as the Silverton
Northern. This railroad was justified as both the Silver Lake and
Sunnyside mines carried a good deal of gold.</p>
<p>At the turn of the century the most talked of and anticipated event in
the mining country was the Meldrum Tunnel which was to bore through the
range west of Red Mountain town and connect with mines at Pandora near
Telluride on the other side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>The tunnel was to be large enough to contain a railroad which was to
connect the Silverton Railroad with the Rio Grande Southern at Pandora.
This would have saved much mileage and would, except at the ends, have
been free from snow.</p>
<p>Andrew Meldrum, a Scotchman, the originator of the project, raised money
and started work in 1898. He left a point on the west side one and a half
miles south of Pandora and drilled eastward until he had reached a depth of
1400 feet. Except for one joggle it was quite straight. At the same time he
ran another tunnel westward from a point about one-half of a mile north of
Joker Tunnel to a depth of 600 feet or more. Altogether he drilled about 1.6
miles on the west side and .6 mile on the east side. Finally, in 1900,
with 3.4 miles yet to go, he ran out of money and had to abandon the project.</p>
<p>However, Meldrum&rsquo;s dream did materialize in 1946 during World War
II when the government loaned the Idarado Mining Company, which had
bought the old Treasury Tunnel workings at Red Mountain, the money to
complete a tunnel through the mountain to the Pandora side. It takes several
drops and rises and goes in various directions in order to contact the ore
veins, so that the total length is 7&frac12; miles. This amount does not include
some tail tunnels.</p>
<p>The Idarado property is now considered one of the richest in the world
for hardrock ores&mdash;silver, gold, lead, zinc, copper and manganese.</p>
<p>Meldrum lived out his life in Ouray and died in a cabin there all alone,
a few years too soon to see his dream come true.</p>
<p>Everybody hoped and expected that mining would soon revive but the
time dragged on and it did not. William Jennings Bryan ran for president of
the United States in 1896 on a &ldquo;free coinage of silver&rdquo; platform and the
&ldquo;Silver San Juan&rdquo;, Mears especially, ardently campaigned for him. When Bryan
was defeated, Mears gave up on a mining revival and early in 1897 moved to
the East. There he took up several business enterprises and stayed for ten
years. However, he retained a general supervision over his railroads and made
numberless trips back to the San Juan.</p>
<p>Revenues had decreased so greatly that the railroad was finally, in 1898,
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
forced into receivership. Alex Anderson, a Scotchman and a former auditor,
was made the receiver.</p>
<p>The Crawford interests who were promoting the Joker Tunnel (a drainage
operation) got control of the railroad in a foreclosure sale in 1904. On
November 3 of that year it was incorporated by Otto Mears, Alex Anderson,
John Ewing, George Crawford and Harry Riddell as the Silverton Railway,
with Mears as president. The new company replaced the old 30-lb. steel with
45-lb. Mr. Ridgway, as superintendent at this time, 1904 and 1905, had to keep
three sets of books&mdash;one for the S. R., one for the S. Ry. and one for the S.N.</p>
<p>Just before and after the reorganization, business revived until it was
nearly as good as in the beginning though only one passenger train ever ran
again and then only as far as Joker Tunnel. The train consisted of two
coaches and a baggage car to Red Mountain where one coach was set out and
the rest went on to Joker. In 1912 a daily passenger was running only as
far as Red Mountain. In 1919 and &rsquo;20 a passenger was still going to the
same destination. During this period about two freights operated though the
number depended on the amount of business. A little engine could haul
three loads up to Red Mountain and a big one could haul five. Both handled
ten loads down. In the winter operation was suspended either for short periods
or for the season because of snow blockades.</p>
<p>The turntable was still standing in early 1906 for John Crum who that
spring drove a logging team from Albany Gulch to the Gold Lion mine, at
night turned his horses loose on a flat nearby and in the morning had to play
tag with them around the table to catch them.</p>
<p>Mears, who was expecting great things of the Cold Prince mine and
mill at Animas Forks on the Silverton Northern, decided he needed a turntable
worse there than at Corkscrew. So, in the summer of 1906, Edward
Meyer, an engineer, took a train to the gulch to retrieve all essential and
removable parts along with other appurtenances. These were then transported
to and installed at Animas Forks.</p>
<p>Joe Dresbach, the general manager of the time, has also stated that
essential and removable parts of the turntable at Corkscrew were retrieved
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
and installed at Animas Forks.</p>
<p>Charles Decker, an engineer, says that the housing and operating parts
of the turntable at Corkscrew were gone when he went there for the first
time in 1907. The train merely ran over the stationary table onto a switchback
that had been extended to hold several cars, and then backed out.</p>
<p>After the turntable was abandoned a train leaving Red Mountain headed
into Corkscrew Gulch, backed down to Joker Tunnel, headed into Corkscrew
again and finally backed to Red Mountain. Or the operation was reversed by
backing out of Red Mountain to begin with. As trains will not back through
much snow downhill and practically none uphill this railroad got into trouble
in the winter no matter how it started out or what it did.</p>
<p>Mears was employed by the D. &amp; R. G. to reconstruct the railroad in the
Animas canyon after the disastrous flood of October 5, 1911. He used S. Ry.,
S. G. &amp; N. and S. N. engines and crews to work from the north end. Trains
went to Joker Tunnel to pick up rails that had been brought that far by
freight teams from Ouray. Silverton ran out of coal, and some that had already
been hauled to the Treasury Tunnel at Red Mountain was brought back to
town. In about 60 days the line was open and the first two freight cars to
arrive in Silverton were one of caskets and one of beer.</p>
<p>Many derailments and minor accidents occurred but in its 39 years of
operation only one fatality. In 1902 or &rsquo;03 an engine ran off a short rail at
Sheridan Junction causing it to overturn. The engineer, Bally Thompson, was
caught and crushed under the boiler. The whole top of his head and jaw were
torn off and his skin was cooked like that of a roasted turkey.</p>
<p>The year ending June 30, 1911 showed a cash balance of $9 while the
year ending December 31, 1917 turned up with a deficit of $25,241. Regular
operation ceased in 1921 and abandonment proceedings were held in the early
fall of 1922. All rolling stock, including Engines 100 and 101 (1) were turned
over to the S. N.</p>

<p>As the track was not immediately removed an occasional train was run
to Red Mountain or even to the mines beyond. With the salvaging of the rails
in 1926 the Silverton Railroad made its last run.</p>
<p>The original Red Mountain Town was on the east side of the small hill
called the Knob. The place began declining about 1907 and the time came
when it was deserted and all structures were in a state of near or complete
collapse. The Idarado, the old Treasury Tunnel, to the north side of the Knob,
with all its prosperous looking mine and mill buildings and its nice dwellings,
most of which were moved there from Eureka, now constitutes the town of
Red Mountain. <i>This</i> Tunnel is a World War II development and is famous
because it bores through the mountain to the mines on the Telluride side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>The new highway has almost obliterated the old railroad grade. It may
be seen crawling along on the sidehill up to Burro Bridge, and again at
Chattanooga Loop and overhead as it climbs to the summit. It also may be
seen curving around the Knob to old Red Mountain town, crawling along
the mountain to Corkscrew Gulch and dropping down to Joker Tunnel. Then
all traces of it are gone except some old grade at Albany. First a road, then a
railroad and again a road!</p>

<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">SILVERTON, GLADSTONE &amp; NORTHERLY</span></h2>
<p>The Gold King Mining Company, under President W. Z. Kinney, promoted
a railroad for the purpose of hauling concentrates from mills along Cement
Creek to the smelters at Silverton. According to the Manual the railroad
was chartered April 6, 1899 and completed in July. James Dyson located the
route and the Rocky Mountain Construction Co., incorporated in Maine,
constructed the 7.5 miles of line and the one-half mile of sidings from Silverton
to Gladstone. Forty-five-pound rail was used. Track left the main line of the
D. &amp; R. G. at the north end of Silverton and there a roundhouse was built. San
Juan County records show that the property was conveyed from the construction
company to the railroad company July 21, 1899. Two figures, $247,838 and
$252,979, have been given as the cost of the job. The difference may have
covered equipment.</p>
<p>The S. G. &amp; N. bought Engine 32 from the Rio Grande Southern through
the D. &amp; R. G. purchasing agent, C. M. Hobbs, for $3252. Mr. Hobbs instructed
Mr. Lee, general superintendent of the R. G. S., to letter it properly, deliver it
to W. Z. Kinney at Silverton on August 1, 1899 and collect the money. Two
very nice made-to-order coaches, that had seats for passengers in one end
and baggage compartments in the other, were obtained. Two trains ran daily
consisting, generally, of an engine, two loads and a passenger coach. The
first year of operation showed a surplus of $35,366.21.</p>
<p>The company, evidently, did not have enough power and in October
1900 it was asking the R. G. S. for another locomotive like the one it already
had, but none was available. Meanwhile, a company in Palestine, Texas had
bought R. C. S. 33 (exactly like 32) but on finding it unsatisfactory, had
shipped it back. The R. G. S. placed it in the Burnham Shops at Denver where,
in 1902, it underwent extensive repairs. Then it was sold to the S. G. &amp; N.</p>
<p>The two locomotives mentioned above were sisters to the Silverton Railroad&rsquo;s
No. 101 (1), formerly R. G. S. 34. All three were of the same make
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
and the same class and had the same owners at the same time and in the same
order&mdash;the D. &amp; R. G., the R. G. W. and the R. G. S. All of these engines ended
up with the S. N. (So did S. R. No. 100.) All had five owners. The 33 had
six owners if one would count the company in Texas but, as far as is known,
no money changed hands.</p>
<p>A new locomotive, No. 34, a Baldwin of the 100 class, was purchased
in 1904. The Manual of 1905 lists three engines, two coaches, and twenty
freight cars; the one of 1909 says two locomotives, two coaches, ten box cars
and twenty-one gondolas. Engine 32 was the one out of service at this time.
Eventually its boiler went to a sawmill at Cascade. No. 33 lasted a few years
longer.</p>
<p>Except for Mr. Kinney of Silverton, the board of ten directors elected in
1904 were all from Maine, Massachusetts or New Brunswick and the trustee
under the mortgage was the Newtonville Trust Co. of Newtonville, Mass.
In 1905 the funded debt was $100,000 and the outstanding stock, $121,000.
In the year ending June 30, 1909, the railroad had carried 16,667 tons of freight
and 3,916 passengers.</p>
<p>It was not uncommon for service to be discontinued for short or long
periods in any winter on account of snow blockades but the suspension in the
fall of 1911 was due to the extensive washouts on the D. &amp; R. G. in the Animas
Canon. S. G. &amp; N. men and equipment were sent to assist in the reconstruction.</p>
<p>Excursions were often run to Gladstone for picnics or to gather columbines
either to send out of town for some special doings or for any kind of local
celebration.</p>
<p>According to the Official Guides of 1913, 1914 and 1915 mixed trains
ran thrice weekly&mdash;Monday, Wednesday and Friday. In 1913 trains left
Silverton at 1:00 P.M. and arrived at Gladstone at 1:45 P.M.; left Gladstone
at 2:15 P.M. and arrived at Silverton at 3:00 P.M. This was a considerable
decline from the original two trains per day.</p>
<p>About the first of January 1910, Mears, Slattery and Pitcher leased the
Gold King mine. On January 15 of the same year the Silverton Northern
Railroad leased the S. G. &amp; N. and five years later, on June 10, 1915, bought
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
it at auction. San Juan County records show that the deed was made July 23.
Mears then owned all three railroads. Only one S. G. &amp; N. engine, the 34, was in
service. The partners gave up the lease on the mine in 1917 and Mears, then
77 years old, left for California, never to return.</p>
<p>Mrs. Percy Airy has a little story to tell of this period. In 1911 her
husband was working at the Gold King mill at Gladstone and they were
living in a little cabin with almost no furniture and conveniences. One
morning while she was washing, Percy came rushing in, saying he was bringing
his uncle Jack Slattery, Otto Mears, James Pitcher and Louis Quarnstrom
in for dinner. Flustered and dismayed were no words for it! At such
a camp no fresh stuff was available but she managed a dinner of ham,
scalloped potatoes, a canned vegetable, biscuits with butter and jam, fresh
canned mountain raspberries, cake and coffee. She had only two stool chairs
and one of them was occupied by the washtub which Mears urged her not
to move. She put one man on the other stool chair, two on the bed and two
in rockers. Being very young, only nineteen, she was so embarrassed she
wouldn&rsquo;t sit down at the table. Everybody praised her dinner and she felt better.
When Mears left he presented her with a very rich piece of gold ore, about
the size of a large orange, and told here if she&rsquo;d always keep that she&rsquo;d
never be poor. Later she engaged a jeweler to make a watch charm from
it for her husband. A small cracked charm and two small pieces of ore
were all that was returned to her. The fellow claimed he had had to break
the big chunk all to pieces to get the charm and had thrown the scraps
away. Of course every small grain of that ore was valuable.</p>
<p>Business kept dwindling until only an occasional train was run. The
following table indicates that the track was still lying in 1923.</p>

<p>No exact date can be found for the tearing up of the rails but it probably
was in 1926, the same year the S. R. was dismantled. All equipment went
to the S. N. as it already belonged to it anyway.</p>
<p>The government, during our war with Japan, established military posts
in Alaska. The railroad up there, the White Pass and Yukon, needed more
locomotives and in 1942 it purchased all that were left on the S.N.&mdash;the
3, 4 and 34. (The S. N. had ceased operation three years previously.) The
34, as should be remembered, had belonged to the S. G. &amp; N. When the
Alaskan railroad received the 34 it numbered it &ldquo;24&rdquo;. After Diesel power
was obtained there the 24 (nee 34), then about forty years old, was retired
to the boneyard.</p>
<p>One of the original S. G. &amp; N. coaches was bought from the S. N., moved
to Durango and set up on Main Avenue as the &ldquo;Pioneer Diner&rdquo;. Later, after
changes and additions, it became the &ldquo;Chief Diner&rdquo;. It is still operating
and may be seen in Durango.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">SILVERTON NORTHERN</span></h2>
<p>Mears hoped to run a railroad from Silverton to Mineral Point and
possibly on to Lake City, following practically the same route as the wagon
road he had built twelve years previously. C. W. Gibbs, chief engineer,
made surveys from Silverton to Eureka in both 1889 and &rsquo;90 but nothing
was immediately attempted, probably because of all effort and money going
toward the construction of the Rio Grande Southern. However, two miles
from Silverton to Waldheim were built in 1893 as an extension of the
Silverton Railroad.</p>
<p>According to San Juan County records the Silverton Northern was
incorporated on September 20, 1895. Fred Walsen was the president, Otto
Mears the vice-president and Alex Anderson the secretary-treasurer.</p>
<p>Construction began at the North Star bridge, the end of the first
piece of railroad, in late April of 1896 and the 6&frac12; miles were completed to
Eureka in late June. The transfer of the property from the construction
company to the railroad company was made on July 1st. Silverton Northern
books gave the cost of construction as $272,400. Meanwhile the first two miles
had been transferred from the Silverton Railroad to the Silverton Northern.
A big celebration took place at Eureka on the completion of the line and
Mrs. Edward G. Stoiber drove the golden spike. A picture is extant which
shows the crowd there.</p>
<p>S. R. Engine 101 was transferred to the S. N. but henceforth was to
go by the number of 1. Of course, the company could borrow a locomotive
or other equipment from the S. R. or the D. &amp; R. G. as needed.</p>
<p>Ever since the panic of 1893 with its demonetization of silver, mining
in the San Juan had been seriously crippled but, since the Sunnyside mine
near Eureka and the Silver Lake mine near Waldheim produced good values
in gold, the S. N. could make a profit.</p>
<p>Mining men, Mears among them, had great hopes that mining would
revive as of old if William Jennings Bryan could be elected as president.
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
Bryan, it should be remembered, was running in 1896 on a platform of silver
coinage at 16 to 1 with gold. When he was defeated Mears lost hope for
any improvement in mining and moved to the East where he took up several
projects. One was the building of the Chesapeake Beach railroad from Washington
to the beach. Another was the promotion of the Mack Truck Co.
with himself as the first president. He, at that early date, saw the possibilities
of automobile transportation.</p>
<p>Though Mears stayed in the east until 1907 he exercised a strong supervision
over his San Juan railroads and made a number of trips back to the
country to oversee them.</p>
<p>In 1901 the company owned one locomotive, one passenger coach, ten
box cars and one service car. For the year ending June 30, 1901 it had
operated 3376 miles of mixed and 1310 miles of passenger service. In 1902
it paid a dividend of 10%.</p>
<p>The Gold Prince mine, four miles up the Animas River canon from
Eureka, was then flourishing so Mears decided to build a railroad to the place.
He hired Thomas Wigglesworth as surveyor and constructor. Construction
from Silverton to Eureka had been easy&mdash;no hard grading and only two
small bridges&mdash;but from Eureka to Animas Forks, the little town near the
Gold Prince, it was to be very difficult&mdash;up a rough canon and over 7%
to 7&frac12;% grade, the very maximum for a steam railroad.</p>
<p>Mr. Vest Day gives an account of its building:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Thomas Wigglesworth, for whom I had worked several times before,
hired me to get stuff together and go up to Animas Forks to establish a
camp. Late in May of 1904 I loaded on the train at Durango about a carload
of surveyor&rsquo;s equipment and camp supplies, among which was a 350-lb.
cook stove, all to be taken by rail to Eureka. There the two Peck brothers
packed it on burros and, since the snow was deep and soft, they often had
to spread gunny sacks out for the burros to step on, especially for the one
with the stove, to keep them from sinking in too deeply. Everything arrived
at Animas Forks in good order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The snow was six feet deep around the cabins we were to occupy so I
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
had to shovel paths and dig down to get the doors open. Then I had to
gather wood out of the tree tops but had the stove up and a good supper ready
when Mr. Wigglesworth arrived with three other young fellows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We first did some preliminary surveying, running a line from Animas
Forks to the divide in case Mr. Mears should decide on a railroad to Lake
City. The snow was so deep we could not drive the stakes so we cut turning
points in the hard crust with a hatchet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we started to work in the canon which was a hard problem and
had labored a month trying to get a line up the east side when Mr. Wigglesworth
remarked to Mr. Mears that he&rsquo;d like to build the railroad on the
other side where the road was. Mears told him to go ahead and take it
as it was his road anyway. Even though we used the road grade, still a lot of
work had to be done and R. T. F. Simpson, who was to run the commissary,
brought with him from New Mexico, 100 Navajo Indians to do the rough
labor. About 25 whites were employed but they acted as powder men, clerks
or other such things. We were all finished in the fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While we were there Mr. Wigglesworth procured for Roy Goodman and
me a railroad bicycle that Mears had had made for Mrs. Stoiber. She was not
at that time using it. This contraption had a framework to which was fastened
four light-weight flanged wheels with rubber on them, that ran on the track.
Above was a platform on which were two stationary bicycles side by side.
The riders treadled the bicycles and the two chains that pulled the two
rear wheels and were connected with two small wheels on the axle of the car,
drove the car, so it ran nicely on the track. We had a grand time going back
and forth to Silverton on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marion A. Speer, a lad from Texas, went to work in the spring of 1904
as a nipper on the railroad which was building from Eureka to Animas Forks.
His job was to carry heavy tools such as drills and picks from the blacksmith
shop to the drilling and blasting crews, and the dull ones back. The work
was very hard but he had to have the money if he expected to go to the
Colorado School of Mines, which was his intention. One day Wigglesworth,
his boss, came to him and told him he&rsquo;d have to let him go as the work was
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
too heavy for him. Marion, then, proceeded to &ldquo;bawl his eyes out&rdquo;. When
Wigglesworth found out the reason he not only took him back but hired
a Mexican boy to help him.</p>
<p>The construction outfit used Engine 3 which was brand new that year,
was very powerful and a beauty and was called &ldquo;Gold Prince&rdquo; after the mine
at Animas Forks. That piece of railroad was completed in the fall except for
sidings which were laid the next year.</p>
<p>Young Speer worked at the Silver Lake mill for several summers and
often got to ride in Engine 100; he also went to Gladstone in the 34 and
was on the S. N. coach, the Animas Forks, when it turned over the first time.
The track still lay to Albany in 1907 for a train took a bunch of picnickers,
of which he was one, down that way and let them off.</p>
<p>The railroad workers, among whom was Speer, ate at the Silver Wing
(Condit) boarding house, and they were lolling around outside one evening
in June of 1904 when a terrific explosion took place at the Toltec blacksmith
shop, directly across the river, about 200 feet away. Debris of all descriptions
peppered the boarding house.</p>
<p>The Silverton <i>Standard</i> reported the event thus:</p>
<p><i>An Awful Explosion</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Three men, Percy Kemper, Edward Crane and
L. W. Lofgren, were killed last Sunday night about ten o&rsquo;clock by a powder
explosion at the Toltec Tunnel of the Sioux Mining Company, located above
Eureka near the mouth of Picayune Gulch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kemper and Crane were literally blown to pieces, parts of their bodies
being found in different places, 300 and 400 yards from the scene of the
explosion. The blacksmith shop was, of course, demolished. When the sound of
the explosion brought others to the scene, Lofgren was still alive, but he died on
the way to Silverton. The remains of the other two unfortunate men were
brought to this city Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lofgren, it seems, had been working behind a metal mine car which
absorbed much of the force of the explosion. This accounts for the fact that
Lofgren was not killed outright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the coroner&rsquo;s inquest held Monday a verdict was returned that the
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
three men came to their deaths by and through carelessness in heating powder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The largely attended triple funeral was held Wednesday afternoon under
the auspices of the Miner&rsquo;s Union of which all three of the deceased
were members in good standing, the local Odd Fellows, however, turning
out in honor of their deceased brother, Lofgren. Reverend Shindler preached
the funeral sermon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vest Day reports that his survey crew helped pick up the pieces of the
bodies the next morning and put them into nail kegs.</p>
<p>Mr. Meyer, the locomotive engineer on the construction crew, claimed
the Indians would stop work on almost any pretext but especially to chase
ground hogs. Mears decided to put a stop to such foolishness and hired 25
white kids and supplied them with rifles to kill the animals. It didn&rsquo;t help
much because when they were out of the way the Indians could find plenty
of other excuses to dawdle.</p>
<p>Mr. Arthur Ridgway stated that when he came to the S. N. in October
of 1904 work was still going on under the supervision of Marshall B. Smith,
Mears&rsquo;s son-in-law, with Navajo labor. Operation of the line began the next
Spring after the snow went off.</p>
<p>In 1905 Mr. Ridgway surveyed and built a branch from Howardsville up
Cunningham Gulch to the Green Mountain and Old Hundred mines, which
added 1.3 miles of railroad to the system. The S. N. must have been in
financial straits at this time for Mears had to raise money in New York
to pay interest on the bonds.</p>
<p>This railroad went north from Silverton as did the other two. The
termini of the S. R. and S. N. were not much more than six air miles apart
with the S. G. &amp; N. in between. Animas Forks is at the foot of Mineral
Point. One may ride out on the top of Mineral Point, as this writer has
done and see the waters divide, the Uncompahgre going to the north and the
Animas to the south. Mears never got the courage to build a railroad up
there as first projected nor on to Lake City.</p>
<p>During the year ending June 30, 1905 the railroad carried 31,433 passengers
and 43,349 tons of freight. The Manual or Guide lists for 1905,
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
two engines, for 1909, three and for 1911, two. One or two passenger cars,
one or two baggage and several freight cars were claimed. It should be remembered
that equipment was interchanged between these little lines and
was also borrowed from the D. &amp; R. G.</p>
<p>The S. N. used or acquired S. R. Engines 100 and 1. Then it bought an
old one from the D. &amp; R. G, which it numbered 2, but it was of such little
good it was soon scrapped. Mears bought the 3 new in 1904 and the 4 new
in 1906, both Baldwins of the 76 class. In 1910 the S. N. leased and in
1915 bought the S. G. &amp; N. and got its engines, the 32, 33 and 34. Numbers
100, 32 and 33 were scrapped between 1909 and 1912 but 1 was still in use
in 1916 for it is shown in the picture of the zinc train that was running
at that time. All four of those just noted sat for a number of years in the
boneyard at Silverton. Numbers 3 and 4 were used on the snow bucking
because 34 was too large for the plow.</p>
<p>Mears could always think up something novel and smart. He had already
put out the silver and gold passes and had devised the railroad bicycle
but now he wanted to do something special in the way of a passenger coach
for this run. He bought an old narrow gauge sleeper from the D. &amp; R. G.,
that had been used on the run from Pueblo via Salida to Alamosa after 1890
and is thought to have been one of those that came to Durango and Silverton
From &rsquo;81 to &rsquo;83. He had it painted a bright green, put the words in gold,
&ldquo;Silverton Northern Railroad&rdquo; over the windows and named it the &ldquo;Animas
Forks&rdquo;. It had four upper and four lower berths on each side, half as many as
a modern sleeper has. It was different also in that the berths had wooden
slat bottoms instead of solid metal as we know them. Ten feet or less
at one end was walled off for a kitchen while 20 feet or more was equipped
with seats and tables. There was a menu card, lengthy and beautifully
printed, and a liquor list to delight a connoisseur. Of course a porter was
present to administer the drinks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>The engine <i>pushed</i> the cars from Eureka to Animas Forks. It would not
have done to have had them behind for, if a coupling had broken, the brakes
would not have been able to hold them on such a steep grade and a
runaway and wreck would have resulted. As, at first, there was no way
of turning at Animas Forks the engine had to back down <i>pulling</i> the cars,
a decidedly risky business. A turntable was desperately needed and so, in
1906 or &rsquo;07, Mears used certain parts of the one at Corkscrew Gulch to
complete the one he was building at Animas Forks. Then the engine could
turn and, by setting the cars on a spur, could get ahead and keep them
from running away. Before starting they tested the brakes most thoroughly;
then the brakeman stayed on top of the cars clubbing them all the way
down. Everybody breathed a sigh of relief when they got stopped at Eureka.</p>
<p>They generally hauled a car of coal and an empty or a coach up
and three cars of ore down. The biggest load ever taken up was a car of
coal and a car of cement. Speed from Silverton to Eureka was ten miles
per hour but from Eureka to Animas Forks, four miles, and the same on
the return trips.</p>
<p>The Stoiber brothers had developed the Silver Lake mine in Arastra
Gulch and built the mill at the mouth of the gulch; later Ed took over the
mine and Gus the mill. Mr. and Mrs. Ed built a home they called Waldheim
which, because of its size&mdash;ball room, game rooms, etc.&mdash;and its fine construction
and expensive furnishings, became known as the &ldquo;Mansion&rdquo;. There
they entertained most lavishly, often passing out expensive party or dinner
favors. (The author acquired one of them&mdash;a beautifully engraved solid
silver dinner spoon.)</p>
<p>The madam undertook a good part of the management of the mine herself,
sometimes all of it, and was capable of subduing the most obstreperous
miner who ever landed there. She was the lady who, to spite her neighbors,
built the tall fence around her place in Silverton.</p>
<p>They left Silverton about 1904 and, after Stoiber died, the madam erected
a fine home in Denver, surrounding it with a fence. She had one husband
before Stoiber and two others afterwards but no one knows for sure what
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
became of them. Her last home was a villa in Italy where she died. A large
fortune was left behind which is still being handed down to heirs of heirs.</p>
<p>Mears signed a contract with the Gold Prince mine at Animas Forks, to
haul its ore to Silverton over the winter of 1906-07. Therefore, it was
necessary to prepare against the vicious snow slides between Eureka and
Animas Forks. He decided to build several heavily timbered snow sheds and
anchor them in rock in the hillsides. The first, 500 feet long, at a bad
place near the Silver Wing boarding house, not far from Eureka, was completed
in October. A slide that winter smashed it and dumped it into the
Animas River Canon. Mears gave up on snow sheds.</p>
<p>On March 24, 1906 concussion, which is the rush of air at the edges
of a slide, did great damage to the Green Mountain mill in Cunningham
Gulch and killed the mine foreman. It also destroyed several S. N. cars.
At the same time a slide demolished the boarding house at the Shenandoah
mine and killed twelve men.</p>
<p>Near Animas Forks two men were asleep in the same bed. One was
thrown toward the center of the room and carried away while the other was
thrown toward the wall and was saved. In the same season two men were
killed at the Robert Bonner mine near Burro Bridge on the S. R.</p>
<p>These are only samples of slides that happened nearly every winter.
Often bodies, frozen stiff, were recovered from slides and stood against
the handiest wall.</p>
<p>One summer a request came to Silverton for a great quantity of columbines
for some national convention that was to be held in Denver. A &ldquo;Columbine
Special&rdquo; train was run from Silverton to Animas Forks for the purpose of
procuring them. Mears donated the use of the train, railroad men donated
their services and townspeople donated their time. They gathered what they
estimated to be 25,000. A hardware man supplied washtubs in which the
flowers were packed and shipped. They went out of Silverton on flat cars but
were transferred to box cars at Alamosa. The columbines reached Denver
and were displayed in front of the Denver Post building.</p>
<p>The Pullman was in a couple of wrecks, the first in the summer of 1908.
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
New rail was being laid and hadn&rsquo;t, in one place, been spiked. Meyer was
the engineer and was pulling a train of three coaches going south when the
accident happened near Silver Lake, two miles out of Silverton. The engine
and one coach went over the rail all right but the next coach caught on it,
turned over and took the Pullman with it. When Conductor Hudson came
along getting people out he found one woman with her head and shoulders
completely through a window on the under side. The car had lit on a couple
of ties, which held it up, preventing her from being crushed. Only her hat
was knocked off. When settlements were made the worst casualty was found
to be a box of peaches for which the owner asked and received 75 cents.</p>
<p>Another time, about 1911, a train was going north when, near Waldheim,
the Pullman, which had too long a wheelbase for curves, gave a swing
and the top part left the trucks, flopping over and taking a coach with
it. Booker was the engineer this time, Hudson, the conductor and Ruble,
the fireman. When they arrived they found the dust so thick they could
scarcely see or breathe. Ruble and Hudson walked along on the sides of the
coaches pulling people out of the windows. They came to Mrs. William Terry
securely fastened and soon found the trouble&mdash;her skirt was caught between
a rock and the side of the coach. Ruble used his pocket knife to cut
a piece out of the back. The poor fellow, easily embarrassed anyway, never
heard the end of cutting off the lady&rsquo;s skirt.</p>
<p>How Mrs. Terry remembers it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a Saturday afternoon in the summer time and the train was
full of people going home from Silverton. In the Pullman everybody was talking
and joking and having a good time. Suddenly the car gave a flop over
on one side and everything was confusion. I was thrown against the slats
of the berth and got several bumps on the head. I grabbed a handful of
willows out the window which pulled through my hand leaving green streaks
that lasted for days. My skirt was caught at the back and someone cut a chunk
out of it. It had been jerked loose from the waist anyway so it came off.
But those were the days when women wore petticoats and I had a nice one
of iridescent taffeta, that rustled and had reams of ruffles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;Broken glass had flown in every direction and many people had cuts.
One woman who had on a white dress came up to me and asked me if her hat
was on straight. I told her it was but that she had better look at her dress. The
whole front of it was covered with other people&rsquo;s blood. Passengers sat on
the hill waiting for a train to come for them. Everybody was very excited
and upset. The porter went around offering drinks to help settle our nerves
but I didn&rsquo;t take any. Cuts and bruises were the worst damages. The injured
were loaded in a box car and taken to the hospital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My garb was a towel around my head, the coat of my just-past beautiful
new plaid suit and the rustling ruffled petticoat. The suit, of course, was
ruined as a skirt to match could not be obtained. I never got any damages,
either, because I was riding on a pass. I lost two combs, too, that had real
gold trimming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Pullman had made its last trip. It was pulled into the D. &amp; R. G.
yards at Silverton where it sat for a while, was gradually dismantled and
finally burned. W. L. Bruce of Durango, about 1920, took some parts of
the doors and door casings and some of the slats of the berths&mdash;all beautiful
cherry wood&mdash;and made a porch swing.</p>
<p>A picture of the front part of the zinc or &ldquo;Zinc Special&rdquo; train of World
War I years is shown herein. A newspaper called the first shipment of ten
cars &ldquo;the largest ever made in Colorado.&rdquo; Zinc with copper made the brass
that was used in shells. A train of ten carloads of rich concentrates was
shipped about once a week from the Sunnyside mill at Eureka, was picked
up by the D. &amp; R. G. at Silverton and transported to a smelter at Pueblo in
48 hours.</p>
<p>The Terry family, owners of the famous Sunnyside mine, the biggest
shipper on the D. &amp; R. G., was dickering with the U. S. Smelting and Refining
Company regarding the sale of the mine and chartered a train for the use of
those coming to investigate. A group of eastern capitalists&mdash;seven of them
millionaires&mdash;accompanied by mining engineers, clerks, servants etc., made
the trip in January or 1917. The train was the D. &amp; R. G. president&rsquo;s narrow
gauge special, thought to be the only one of its kind in existence. The cars
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
were beautifully finished and furnished. It was so outstanding and unique as
to have been exhibited at the World&rsquo;s Fair at San Francisco in 1915.</p>
<p>Snow was pretty deep. Much good stuff was on the train and the crew
got slightly befuddled. Just at the north end of Silverton the coupling
back of the engine came loose and the engineer went several miles before he
noticed he had lost the train. He did some quick thinking and plowed the
track on to Eureka. When he came back he told everybody that the snow was
so deep he thought it better to go ahead and clear the line and then come
back and get the train.</p>
<p>The outfit parked at Eureka for about a week while officials and engineers
made a thorough investigation of the Sunnyside which, a few months later,
resulted in the sale of the mine. On the way back to Durango the train,
called the &ldquo;Million Dollar Special&rdquo;, was wrecked about a mile south of
Rockwood. The engine and the three coaches turned over. Nobody was
seriously hurt but two of the cars caught fire from the cookstove and completely
burned.</p>
<p>In February 1906, three passenger trains on week days and two on
Sundays ran between Silverton and Eureka. In 1913 a train, running six
days per week, left Silverton at 8:30 A.M. and arrived at Eureka at 9:15,
left Eureka at 10:15 and arrived in Silverton at 11:00. In 1919 and &rsquo;20
a schedule as follows was in operation: leave Silverton at 8:00 A.M. for
Eureka, back at 10:00, leave for Joker Tunnel on the S. R. at 10:00, back at
2:00; leave for Eureka at 3:00, back at 5:00;&mdash;two trips to Eureka and one
to Joker Tunnel seven days per week.</p>
<p>Though there seems to have been no scheduled service in 1923, at
least the track was still lying and trains must have been run as needed.
This period, it should be remembered, was one of hard times following World
War I.</p>

<p>The branch to Green Mountain operated only a short time because the
mines up that way turned out to be poor producers. The part from Eureka
to Animas Forks is claimed never to have paid expenses and soon quit
regular operation though occasional trains ran up there until sometime in the
twenties. Mears offered the right-of-way to the county if it would take up the
track, which it did, and Mr. Meyer hauled the junk down in
1936.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> Like
the S. R., it was a road to begin with and ended up by being one again.</p>
<p>The section from Silverton to Eureka revived and lasted the longest of
any of the three little railroads. Ore was shipped over it from the Sunnyside
mine and mill until 1939 when the mine closed down because of a miner&rsquo;s
strike.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1942 the property was advertised for sale for $17,000
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
in delinquent taxes. Mrs. Cora Pitcher, Mears&rsquo;s daughter, sold it to the
Dullen Steel Products Company and paid the taxes. This company shipped
the shop equipment, rails and rolling stock out in October.</p>
<p>The United States had, after it became involved in war with Japan,
established military bases in Alaska. The railroad there, the White Pass and
Yukon, needed more motive power and the government requisitioned the
three locomotives, the 3, 4, and 34. There, so R. E. Cooper states, they were
re-numbered to 22, 23 and 24, respectively. In 1947 word was received
from the War Surplus Board and the W. P. &amp; Y. Ry. that twelve engines&mdash;7
D. &amp; R. G., 2 C. &amp; S. and 3 S. N.&mdash;had been received by the Alaska Railroad
but when Diesel power was obtained there, all except No. 34 (24) were
returned to Seattle to M. Block &amp; Co., a junking outfit. The last known
of the 34, it was sitting in the railroad yards at Skagway, Alaska, in a
state of dismantlement.</p>
<p>In 55 years, 1887 to 1942, the three little Silverton railroads started,
prospered, declined and perished and nothing, unless one considers still
discernible roadbeds and rotting ties, remains to attest their existence. No
equipment except one coach, which is scarcely recognizable as such, has
survived. A few little relics such as small amounts of paper material, a
goodly number of pictures and S. R. buckskin, silver and gold passes have
survived and they are scattered from one end of the United States to the
other. Pathetic mementos they are, for agents that played such a large part
in the life and prosperity of their community.</p>

may be made from Denver, Colorado

on the western turn, the course divides.
The traveler may follow the arrows
by the outer, &ldquo;All Rail,&rdquo; route; or

denoted by the arrows and dots. When
purchasing his ticket he has his choice, the
&ldquo;Circle&rdquo; round-trip fare being the same

marked should not be neglected. For them
special low rates are granted; the &ldquo;Circle&rdquo;
ticket permits stop-overs.</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given

not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

without further opportunities to fix the problem.

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
